# Deep learning based approach to predict pulmonary function from chest CT

Code were uploaded onto each branches.    
We'll keep modifying this page and repository for ascertain reproducibility. 



* "training" branch: Code used to train deep learning model to predict FVC and FEV1.

* "test" branch: Code used to get test results, and related figures and tables.
